-The number blocks per grid and the number of threads per block is 
determined by the size of the matrix, N. At minimum, we need at least 
sqrt(N) number of threads. Since the cuda will be tested with N = 2000,
4000,6000, and 8000, the minimum number of threads that it will have is 
8000. I chose to create 32 blocks per grid and 256 threads per block. This
will give use 8192 threads.

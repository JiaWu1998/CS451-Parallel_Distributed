-Compile with: 
gcc -o gauss_pthread gauss_pthread.c -lpthread -lm 

-Test with:
./gauss_pthread <matrix-dimensions> <random-seed>

-My Performance Test:
./gauss_pthread 2000 <random seed>

-Optimization:
version 1: I tried to parallelize everything within 
the norm for loop.(Performance: ~1700-1800ms)

version 2: I tried to parallelize the norm loop and also 
the col loop. However, the performance went down. 
(Performance: ~2400ms)

version 3: I went back to version 1. I just played with the
number of threads.
